PHPluentValidation
===================

### A ~~magic!~~ highly-extensible lightweight fluent validation framework for PHP.

#### BEWARE! This has not been tested rigorously yet! Not sure if it all works fine.

These validation rules are supported out of the box :

 - Required (not null or empty)
 - MaxLength 
 - ... (I know that's not a lot, but come on! This project has been alive for a few hours only)

It's so easy to create new rules that even your sister's kitty cat can do it :
```php
require_once 'phpluent_validation.php' // require the file, only if you want to

class WorldShouldHaveEndedRule
{
	use Rule; //Use the Rule trait for more awesomeness.
	
	/**
	 * The given object will be considered valid only if the world has ended. 
	 */
	public function validate($obj)
	{
		return has_the_world_ended_yet();
	}
}
```
Your class must be discoverable by any registered autoloader, and voilÃ ! You can now create a validator and invoke your new awesome rule :
```php
$v = new Validator();
$v->rule_for('this_is_getting_long')->world_should_have_ended();

$obj = new AnyObject();

$v->validate($obj); // => false
```
This validator will check for function `this_is_getting_long()` on the target object and pass it through the rules defined for this particular function.

### On its way :

 - More unit tests!
 - Autoloader for Validator, Rule trait and already supported rules (so you don't have to require every file)
 - Refactoring to remove unnecessary `$prop` property inside each rule.
 - Support for the same ruleset for different properties defined like this :

```php
//This way, both first_name and last_name will have the required and the max_length rules
$validator->rule_for('first_name')->and_for('last_name')
          ->required()
          ->max_length(100);
```
